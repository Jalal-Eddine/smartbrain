Using the Clarifai API, the Smart Brain application allows users to detect faces on photographs. The user can sign in to their account upon registration. For the front-end, Smart Brain uses ReactJS to render the view. For the back-end, it uses NodeJS and Express to host APIs for handling fetch requests. The back-end is also used to connect to and manage it's Postgres database. With this project, I was able to learn popular libraries and frameworks to create a fully fledged application.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
